## Description
This project is about writing some queries on some data from the 2024-25 NBA season. It utilizes data from an nba_api combined with pandas code on pycharm to filter and only include the 24-25 season's data before exporting that data as a csv file. The csv file is then connected to Beekeeper Studio as an SQLite database so that SQL queries can be done on the dataset.
